hadoop project for school
(project done in scala instead of java)

What is it ?
    count words over distant machine
    it will send Sx.txt files in /tmp/naegel_a/splits to the diferents available machines,
    distant machines will process a count words on th Sx files, it will create UMx
    slaves will send UMx to differents slaves for process a reduce by key
    it will send result throught outputStream process and the master will get the results

how to use:
    Scala and sbt need to be install
    $ sbt clean compile assembly
        it will produce 3 jar files
            -> slave/target/scala-2.12/slave.jar
            -> master/target/scala-2.12/master.jar
            -> deploy/target/scala-2.12/deploy.jar
        theses jar can be run as usual with "$ java -jar [jarfile]" or "$ scala [jarfile]"
    master/src/main/resources/ip_list.txt deploy/src/main/resources/ip_list.txt  need to be fill with ip of the distant
    machines
    deploy/src/main/resources/script.sh can be use for some ssh setup with ip_list as arg
    files to process have to be in /tmp/naegel_a/splits with Sx.txt format
    the deploy jar should be run first for set up dirs and sending slave.jar to the distant machines
    then run the master it will process the countword with distant machines


 misc:
    the slave make a first count words on Sx file instead of return a tuple of each word with a count of 1
    Step 50/51 modified compute in once List[UMx] -> RMx insted of 2 time process List[UMx] -> SMx then SMx -> RMx
    future is used for compute on the machines in a parallel way, but the result (some times) have problemes to come
    back to the master
